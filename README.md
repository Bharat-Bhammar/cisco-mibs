### :book: Usage Guidelines
The suggested way to retrieve the MIBs applicable to the Cisco products that you wish to manage is as follows:
1. For each product, download and open the desired [Support List](https://github.com/cisco/cisco-mibs/tree/main/supportlists) file:
   - `supportlists/[product]/supportlist.txt`
   - `supportlists/[product]/supportlist.html` (Download. Then open locally.)
   - `https://cisco.github.io/cisco-mibs/supportlists/[product]/supportlist.html`
     - e.g: https://cisco.github.io/cisco-mibs/supportlists/nexus9000/Nexus9000MIBSupportList.html
	 - Tip: Replace `ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/` in any saved URL with `https://cisco.github.io/cisco-mibs/` to view in the Browser.
2. Determine which MIBs each product supports from the retrieved file.
   - Consult the `v2/readme` or `v1/readme` file for brief descriptions of the functionality provided by each MIB.
3. Retrieve all MIBs which provide the functionality you are interested in, and are applicable to the Cisco products you wish to support.
   - Example: Download [SNMPv2-MIB.my](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisco/cisco-mibs/main/v2/SNMPv2-MIB.my) as per [ASR1000 Support List](https://cisco.github.io/cisco-mibs/supportlists/asr1000/asr1000-supportlist.html)
   - If you are looking for a specific file click “Go to File” and [search for the filename](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/finding-files-on-github).
     - Tip: You may also use Cisco Feature Navigator to find the desired MIB hosted in this Repo: https://cfnng.cisco.com/mibs
